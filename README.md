# technical-exam

To move into 301, you must build this small project to verify your knowledge of the fundementals of Javascript and web development. Create a new Github repository and copy and paste this MD file in as the README.md, happy hacking!

<h1>Technical Exam technical requirements</h1>
Create an object constructor that will store multiple properties
Display properties to a list in html
Include the ability to add new objects dynamically using inputs, event listeners and handlers
Ensure that new objects persist through page reload using local storage.
Use classes to distinguish to style multiple elements in CSS

<h2>Problem Domain</h2>
Based on your recommendation, your company is hiring several coding bootcamp graduates as developers just like you. They want to have a simple UI that stores information about the new developers and displays them as a list. They want to see the following information about each developer.
<ul>
  <li>Name</li>
  <li>coding school</li>
  <li>programming language</li>

<br/>
They also want you to build it in a way that anyone at the company can add a new developer through the UI without touching the code. They also want to make sure that any new developer that is added in this way is saved in the browser and not lost when you refresh or close the web page.

Think about how you would create these student models, store them, iterate through all the models and then display the models to a web page. Also remember what you learned about local storage and persisting data.

In addition, you will need to utilize an event listener on an input and/or form to allow anyone to add new developers to the list saving you the work of adding code in the future.

Last but not least, give each property it's own class and style them with a different color for a visual queue as a way for the user to distinguish between the different properties.
